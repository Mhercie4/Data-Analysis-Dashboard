## Insights
Key Findings
- Top‑revenue categories: Men’s Street Footwear leads the pack (≈ 23.5 % of sales), followed by Women’s Apparel (≈ 20.2 %) and Men’s Athletic Footwear (≈ 17.1 %). Women’s Street Footwear and Men’s Apparel also show solid contributions.
- Best‑performing regions: South‑East dominates, powered by high‑volume Foot Locker, Sports Direct and Walmart stores. The South follows closely, while the North‑East trails just behind.
- Sales method impact: Online now accounts for 50 % of revenue—the biggest channel by volume. Outlet sales contribute 35 %, and in‑store takes the smallest share.
- Retailer performance: Foot Locker generates the highest absolute sales, with Sports Direct a close second.
- Growth signals: Sales rise steadily through Q1‑Q2, peak in Q3 (back‑to‑school & holiday push), then taper in Q4. This seasonal pattern repeats year‑over‑year.

## Recommendations

- Product Strategy: Double down on Men’s Street Footwear and expand Women’s Apparel lines. Consider phasing out low‑growth accessories or bundling them seasonally.
- Channel Optimization: Invest more marketing budget into the online channel to capture higher margins. Enhance in‑store experiences in top regions to drive foot traffic.
- Regional Focus: Allocate extra inventory to the South‑East and South. Pilot targeted campaigns in emerging markets (e.g., West) to replicate success.
- Demand Forecasting: Deploy a time‑series model like Prophet, leveraging the Q3 seasonality to improve stock planning.
- Retailer & Partner Management: Negotiate performance‑based incentives with Foot Locker. Work with Walmart on high‑margin bundles to lift basket size.
